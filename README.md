# ðŸ’¡ Welcome to Carbon Developer!

The Carbon Developer Cloud was designed for developers looking to integrate Carbon Platform into their group.&#x20;

We try to keep our APIs well-documented, even if they aren't intended for public use.



We do offer development support for our public APIs, and you can request that from support@carbonapp.io
